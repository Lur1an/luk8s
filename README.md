# Luk8s

This repository is a collection of devops stuff. Didn't have a better name for it.


## Charts

All charts are in the `charts` directory, they are published to the `luk8s` [Helm repository](https://lur1an.github.io/luk8s/).

## Sample Workflows

All workflows are in the `.github/workflows/templates` directory. They include useful templates for common methods to build docker images in multiple programming languages.
